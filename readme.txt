This folder contains two implementations for solving the highway problem:
1. The Dynamic Programming Approach:
	Transition matrix is first built by counting method.
	Value iteration is used to get policy.
	Relevant files:

2. Q-learning: 
	Learning accelerated by using solved trajectories from hamilton jacobi eqn (ICRA2020 submission)
	Relevant files:



Input_data_fiiles:
Data for the codes are pathStore.mat, Velx_5K_rlzns.npy, Vely_5K_rlzns.npy
